# modified ST-Matching and STB-Matching Algorithm

This folder contains two Jupyter Notebooks implementing the modified ST-Matching algorithm along with changes needed to implement STB-Matching. The modificatoins include a dynamic buffer, dynamic observation probability, redesigned temporal function and the behavioral analysis
## Features

- Candidate point selection using dynamic buffers  
- Dynamic Observation probability and transition score computations
- Redesigned Temporal Function  
- Construction of candidate graphs (DAG) and shortest path finding  
- Evaluation metrics  
- visualization of matched points and paths  

## Files

- `modified ST_Matching.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook with full implementation and explanation  
- `Behavioral Analysis.ipynb`: The modifications needed to turn the modified ST-Matching algorithm notebook into the STB version
